# notesapp-nodejs

This app was developed in order to learn more of NodeJs

In the api folder we have a server that receives the requests from the frontend and is able to save and delete "links notes" inside of the urls.json

The index.js from the root folder is the frontend server and receives the client requests and sends the html, css and js files to the browser
